## About me

### 👶🏻🍼From 1️⃣1️⃣ to 1️⃣5️⃣
I'm coding since I was 11 years old, before my first real job most of my projects were simples using HTML, CSS and JS. I also played with MSSQL while creating MU Online Servers and some PHP for doing the websites, but in general most of my code was following tutorials on internet.

### 👦🏻🎮 From 1️⃣6️⃣ to 1️⃣8️⃣
When I turned 16 and started creating some real world applications, the first one was for a company that organizes sport competitions. This system was made with Delphi + Firebird + PHP + MySql ... Kinda weird but that was the solution I found for the offline needed that the company had plus sincronization with the website.

### From 1️⃣9️⃣ to 2️⃣1️⃣
Whoow! My first real work!!!
```
while (newbie){
  Waking up at 6:30 am to catch a bus to work from 8 am to 5 pm
  Work on a variety of projects involving PHP, Angular, MongoDB, Postgres, and whatever else clients require.
  After 6 pm, I catch another bus to the university and stay there until 11 pm, followed by one more bus ride home at midnight.
  Finally, it's time to sleep.
}
