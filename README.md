### Hey, I'm Gabriel Cantarin ü§òüèª

## Before We Dive In
- I've put this together because many ANSWERS to common and repetitive QUESTIONS can now be found in a simple documentation.
- I've also grown tired of developers using "copy/paste" for readmes, pretending they know how to code. So, I'm demonstrating how to embrace creativity.
- Just to clarify, I'm not a coach, teacher, or planning to sell any courses, nor am I going to start creating viral tweets.
- The tone might sound a bit blunt, but it's all in good fun. I'm just someone who's really focused on good work. üòâ

## Getting Started

### üë∂üèªüçºFrom 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ to 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£
I've been coding since I was 11 years old. Before I landed my first official job, most of my projects were fairly simple, involving HTML, CSS, and JS. During this time, I also dabbled with MSSQL while setting up MU Online Servers and used PHP for creating a few websites. To be honest, a lot of my code was following online tutorials.

### üë¶üèªüéÆ From 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ to 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£
Around the age of 16, I stepped into the realm of developing real-world applications. My first notable project was for a company that managed sports competitions. The system I created was a blend of Delphi, Firebird, PHP, and MySQL ‚Äî a somewhat unconventional mix. But it got the job done, allowing offline functionality while staying synchronized with the company's website.

### ü§ìüíª From 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ to 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£
And then came my first official job, the moment I had been waiting for!
```python
while newbie:
    wake_up("6:30am")
    take_bus(TO_WORK, "7am", "8am")
    work("8am", "5pm").code("PHP, Angular, MongoDB, Postgres, and whatever else clients require")
    take_bus(TO_UNIVERSITY, "5:30pm", "7:00pm")
    attend_university().join_class("7pm", "11pm")
    take_bus(TO_HOME, "11pm", "00:30am")

    if not party:
        sleep()
```
This period was all about juggling work, university, and the occasional (or not so occasional) party (if I managed to squeeze one in).
