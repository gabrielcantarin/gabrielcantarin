### Hey I'm Gabriel Cantarin🤘🏻

## About me
I'm coding since I was 11 years old, before my first real job most of my projects were simples using HTML, CSS and JS. I also played with MSSQL while creating MU Online Servers and some PHP for doing the websites, but in general most of my code was following tutorials on internet.

When I turned 16 and started creating some real world applications, the first one was for a company that organizes sport competitions.
