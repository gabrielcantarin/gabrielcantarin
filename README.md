### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ to 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£
I'm coding since I was 11 years old, before my first real job most of my projects were simples using HTML, CSS and JS. I also played with MSSQL while creating MU Online Servers and some PHP for doing the websites, but in general most of my code was following tutorials on internet.

When I turned 16 and started creating some real world applications, the first one was for a company that organizes sport competitions. This system was made with Delphi + Firebird + PHP + MySql ... Kinda weird but that was the solution I found for the offline needed that the company had plus sincronization with the website.
