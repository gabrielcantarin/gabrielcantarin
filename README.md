### Hey I'm Gabriel Cantarinü§òüèª

## Getting Start

### üë∂üèªüçºFrom 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ to 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£
I'm coding since I was 11 years old, before my first real job most of my projects were simple using HTML, CSS and JS. I also played with MSSQL while creating MU Online Servers and some PHP for doing few websites, but in general most of my code was following tutorials on internet.

### üë¶üèªüéÆ From 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ to 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£
When I turned 16 and started creating some real world applications, the first one was for a company that organizes sport competitions. This system was made with Delphi + Firebird + PHP + MySql ... Kinda weird but that was the solution I found for the offline needed that the company had plus sincronization with the website.

### ü§ìüíª From 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ to 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£
Whoow! My first real work!!!
```
while (newbie){
  awake("6:30am")->bus("7am", "8am");
  work()->anything("8am","5pm")->paying(); //PHP, Angular, MongoDB, Postgres, and whatever else clients require
  university()->bus("5:30pm", "7pm")->class("7pm","23pm")->bus("23pm", "00:30am")

  if(!party){
    sleep();
  }
}
```
